&quot; The potential productivity gains should be considerable .
Today , QuarkXPress ® 8 has tighter integration with Photoshop ® and Illustrator ® than ever before , and through standards like HTML and CSS , QuarkXPress users can publish across media both independently and alongside Adobe ® Creative Suite ® applications like Adobe Flash ® ( SWF ) and Adobe Dreamweaver ® .
Here , you ’ ll find out how Creative Suite users can get the best possible interaction with QuarkXPress .
You ’ ll be surprised how easy Quark has made it to unlock the full potential of all your design software .
QuarkXPress 8 is considered by many to have the best integration with Photoshop ’ s PSD file format of any layout tool available today .
In this section we ’ ll explain when you should use the PSD format for your images and how to get the most out of them .
For example , you may have multiple layers in your PSD with different product shots , which will vary from publication to publication .
If you use PSD , you can switch those layers on or off in QuarkXPress without having to save a separate TIFF for each publication .
Another question that might tip you in favor of PSD is , &quot; Do I need to use a spot color with this image ?
&quot; Using spot colors in most image formats is often complicated .
However , because of the way QuarkXPress supports PSD channels , it ’ s simpler and more flexible .
Bringing the PSD files into QuarkXPress is the same as any other image . Create a Box and then use File &gt; Import ... or simply drag and drop the image from your desktop , Finder or an application like Adobe Bridge ® with or without creating a box first .
To access the special features of PSD , open the PSD Import palette . ( Window &gt; PSD Import ) You ’ ll instantly see thumbnails of the layers along with their names .
For example , you ’ ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an antiqued look , but when you put it in your layout it seems swamped by the surrounding colors . One option might be to reduce the opacity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new opacity level .
If you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images , you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop . For example , maybe you intend to varnish part of an image , or you want to use a spot color within your image .
QuarkXPress can re ­ map any channel right in the PSD Import palette — non ­ destructively .
So click on the channels divider of the PSD Import Palette ; double click on the channel in question , and you can pick any color from your project ’ s color palette , ensuring consistency .
As powerful as the PSD support of QuarkXPress 8 is , it can ’ t manipulate certain kinds of layers , such as layer effects &#91; e.g.
If you use one of these layers , the image will import and print just fine , but you won ’ t get access to the layer controls of the PSD Import palette .
If you need that functionality , you can eliminate those kinds of layers from your PSD by converting the layer effects to stand ##AT##-##AT## alone layers or &apos; smart objects &apos; &#91; right click on the Layer in the Photoshop layers palette &#93; .
QuarkXPress supports text layers , most adjustment layers , and even 3D layers including opacity and blending mode controls .
Illustrator is a great tool for creating logos and vector illustrations .
Traditionally , the route into QuarkXPress has been to export an EPS from Illustrator .
Now , things are made much easier with the arrival of direct Illustrator .ai file import into QuarkXPress 8 .
Simply drag and drop or import your Illustrator native file into your layout just as you would any graphics file format .
QuarkXPress has a powerful transparency engine , but it doesn ’ t support partially transparent objects in PDF or .ai files yet .
So if you are using something like a drop shadow in Illustrator and plan to place that over a non ##AT##-##AT## white background or object , you might see undesirable results .
The good news is that the drop shadow and transparency features of QuarkXPress works on imported Illustrator files , so you can apply a drop shadow or change the opacity of your .ai file right in your layout instead .
QuarkXPress is well equipped for drawing tasks and in our newest release we have standardised many of our graphics tools to work more like Illustrator , Freehand and similar tools .
